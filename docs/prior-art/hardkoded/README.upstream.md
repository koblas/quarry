# quicken-skills

Skills that let an AI agent explore your **Quicken for Mac** data in plain language,
read-only, across currencies. Packaged as a plugin for Claude Code, Cursor, GitHub Copilot,
and Codex.

Ask things like:

- "What is my net worth in USD, and how much of it is in EUR?"
- "Where did my money go last month?"
- "Which subscriptions got more expensive this year?"
- "How is my portfolio doing? Show unrealized gains by lot."
- "What is wrong with my data? Uncategorized, duplicates, stale accounts."
- "List every transaction tagged vacation in 2024."

## Included skills

| Skill | What it does |
|---|---|
| `quicken-setup` | Finds your `.quicken` file, opens it read-only, defines the normalized SQL views, downloads daily exchange rates. Run first. |
| `quicken-query` | Turns a question into SQL over the views. Ships a schema reference of the Quicken data model. |
| `quicken-net-worth` | Net worth by account, type and currency, and month-by-month history, in one base currency. |
| `quicken-spending` | Spending by category, payee and month, trends, recurring charges, price increases, savings rate. |
| `quicken-investments` | Holdings, allocation, lot-level gains, total return per security, dividends, trades. |
| `quicken-hygiene` | Uncategorized lines, duplicates, one-legged transfers, stale accounts, missing prices and rates. |

## Installation

### Claude Code

```bash
/plugin marketplace add hardkoded/quicken-skills
/plugin install quicken@quicken-skills
```

### Cursor

Import this repository as a team marketplace, then install `quicken` from the Cursor plugin UI.

### GitHub Copilot (VS Code)

Use **Chat: Install Plugin From Source** and provide:

```text
https://github.com/hardkoded/quicken-skills
```

### Codex

```bash
codex plugin marketplace add hardkoded/quicken-skills
codex plugin add quicken@quicken-skills
```

## Requirements

- Quicken Classic for Mac. The data file is a `.quicken` package with a SQLite database inside.
- **The file must be open in Quicken.** Quicken only keeps the database populated while the
  file is open; a closed file has no accounts in it and the setup skill tells you so. Leave
  Quicken running while you ask questions. Every query reads the open file directly, so the
  answers always match what Quicken shows.
- `sqlite3` and `curl`, both included with macOS. Nothing to install.

Quicken for Windows (`.QDF`) is not supported yet. Its file format is not plain SQLite.

## Examples

Ask in plain language. The agent picks the skill, runs the SQL recipe, and explains the
table. The outputs below come from the small synthetic file in `test/` (base currency USD,
one EUR account, one brokerage account), so the numbers are tiny but real.

### Setup

> Connect my Quicken file.

```
$ quicken.sh find
/Users/me/Documents/My Finances.quicken
$ quicken.sh init "/Users/me/Documents/My Finances.quicken"
file:          /Users/me/Documents/My Finances.quicken
rates db:      /Users/me/.quicken-skills/fx.sqlite
base currency: USD
transactions:  8 from 2024-01-15 to 2024-06-01
accounts by currency (open only):
currency  accounts  investment  liability
--------  --------  ----------  ---------
USD       3         1           1
EUR       1         0           0
fx coverage (pair, source, first, last, days):
pair     source       first       last        days
-------  -----------  ----------  ----------  ----
EUR/USD  csv          2024-01-01  2024-02-01  2
EUR/USD  quicken      2026-09-06  2026-09-06  1
```

### Net worth

> What is my net worth, and how much of it is in euros?

| type            | accounts | total_USD |
|-----------------|----------|-----------|
| CHECKING        | 2        | 2345.0    |
| BROKERAGENORMAL | 1        | 605.0     |
| CREDITCARD      | 1        | -80.0     |
| ASSETS          | 2        | 3005.0    |
| LIABILITIES     | 2        | -135.0    |
| NET WORTH       | 4        | 2870.0    |

| currency | cash   | securities | total_USD | share_pct |
|----------|--------|------------|-----------|-----------|
| USD      | 2425.0 | 500.0      | 2925.0    | 101.9     |
| EUR      | -50.0  | 0.0        | -55.0     | -1.9      |

The agent answers: net worth is 2,870 USD (Quicken home currency, rates from the cached CSV
and Quicken's current rate). The euro account is overdrawn by 50 EUR, about 55 USD.

### Spending

> Where did my money go in 2024, and what was my savings rate in January?

| category       | lines | spent_USD | share_pct |
|----------------|-------|-----------|-----------|
| Food:Groceries | 3     | 234.0     | 100.0     |

| month   | income_USD | expenses_USD | net_USD | savings_rate_pct |
|---------|------------|--------------|---------|------------------|
| 2024-01 | 3000.0     | 100.0        | 2900.0  | 97.0             |
| 2024-02 | 0.0        | 54.0         | -54.0   |                  |
| 2024-03 | 0.0        | 80.0         | -80.0   |                  |

The 54 USD in February is a 50 EUR purchase converted at the rate on that day (1.08), not
today's rate. Transfers between accounts are excluded.

Other spending questions: "top payees this year", "which subscriptions do I pay monthly",
"what got more expensive", "biggest expenses last quarter", "this month vs my 12-month average".

### Investments

> How is my portfolio doing?

| account   | security  | ticker | units | price | value | cost_basis | unrealized_gain | gain_pct | weight_pct |
|-----------|-----------|--------|-------|-------|-------|------------|-----------------|----------|------------|
| Brokerage | Test Fund | TST    | 10.0  | 50    | 500.0 | 400.0      | 100.0           | 25.0     | 100.0      |

| security  | status | invested_USD | proceeds_USD | income_USD | value_now_USD | total_gain_USD | gain_pct |
|-----------|--------|--------------|--------------|------------|---------------|----------------|----------|
| Test Fund | open   | 400.0        | 0.0          | 5.0        | 500.0         | 105.0          | 26.3     |

Total return counts the 5 USD dividend. Prices are Quicken's own quote history, so the
agent also reports the price date.

### Data hygiene

> Is there anything wrong with my data?

| check_name                                    | n |
|-----------------------------------------------|---|
| uncategorized lines (period)                  | 0 |
| possible duplicate groups (period)            | 0 |
| one-legged transfers (all time)               | 0 |
| stale open accounts                           | 4 |
| uncleared older than 90 days                  | 4 |
| holdings without a recent price               | 1 |
| positions where lots differ from transactions | 0 |
| split lines with no exchange rate             | 0 |
| currency pairs with stale rates               | 0 |

Then it drills into the non-zero checks and says what each one means for the other numbers.

### Free-form questions

> Show me everything I tagged "vacation".

```sql
SELECT date, account, payee, category, amount, currency, amount_base
FROM q_split_base WHERE tags LIKE '%vacation%';
```

| date       | account  | payee  | category       | amount | currency | amount_base |
|------------|----------|--------|----------------|--------|----------|-------------|
| 2024-01-20 | Checking | Grocer | Food:Groceries | -100   | USD      | -100.0      |

`quicken-query` writes SQL like this against the `q_*` views. Its `reference/schema.md`
documents every view and the raw Quicken tables for anything the views do not cover
(budgets, scheduled transactions, loan terms).

## How it works

1. Every command opens `<file>.quicken/data` with `sqlite3 -readonly` and defines the `q_*`
   views as `TEMP` views for that one session: accounts, categories, split lines, balances by
   month, holdings, quotes, investment transactions. Nothing is copied and nothing is stored
   in the Quicken file, so the data is always current.
2. Quicken stores only one *current* exchange rate per currency pair. To consolidate history,
   the setup skill downloads daily rates (ECB via Frankfurter by default, Yahoo Finance as
   fallback, or a CSV you provide) and caches them in `~/.quicken-skills/fx/`. Every `*_base`
   column converts at the rate on the transaction date.
3. The analysis skills are markdown instructions plus `.sql` recipes. The agent runs them
   with `quicken.sh sql` and explains the result. Numbers come from SQL, not from the model.

The base currency defaults to Quicken's home currency. Change it with `quicken.sh base EUR`.

## Privacy

- The Quicken file is opened read-only, never copied, and nothing inside the package is changed.
  The test suite checks that the file's hash is the same after a full run.
- `~/.quicken-skills` holds only your settings and cached exchange rates (mode 600).
  Delete it at any time; the next `init` recreates it.
- The only network calls are exchange-rate downloads. They contain currency codes and dates,
  never your transactions.
- Your AI agent, of course, sees the query results you ask for. Use an agent you trust with
  your financial data.

Every install path above resolves skills through a plugin manifest's `"skills"` field,
which points at `plugins/quicken/skills/`, the single copy of each skill in this repo.

## Development

```bash
bash test/run.sh
```

Builds an empty Quicken schema (captured from a real 9.x file), loads a few synthetic rows,
runs every view and recipe, and checks known totals. CI runs it on Linux and macOS.
